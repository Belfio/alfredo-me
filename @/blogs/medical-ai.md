# Mirror: medical AI algorithms and datasets

## I am trying to find a good collection of medical imaging datasets and algorithms.

<br>
<br>
I feel there is a lack of websites designed for medical imaging analysis. Kaggle and Hugging-face are not ideal.
<br>
<br>
Algorithms:

- hugging-face
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?searchQuery=cancer
- https://github.com/medtorch/awesome-healthcare-ai?tab=readme-ov-file
- https://github.com/seokkim/Awesome-Medical-Imaging
- https://github.com/AI-in-Health/MedLLMsPracticalGuide

  <br>
  <br>
  Datasets:

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14037705
- https://kms-healthcare.com/blog/healthcare-data-sets/
- https://www.ilovephd.com/websites-download-medical-image-datasets-free/
- https://github.com/sfikas/medical-imaging-datasets
- https://encord.com/blog/best-free-datasets-for-healthcare/
- https://www.v7labs.com/blog/healthcare-datasets-for-computer-vision
- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/medical-image-analysis/downloads/
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?searchQuery=cancer
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

## The ideal website is:

<br>
<br>
1. Datasets section about different deseases or different body parts

2. Each datasets linked to a ranking of the best algos

3. Each algo in a clear ranking (like the LLMs ranking we have now)

4. Ability for people to access the algos / datasets

5. Ability for people to upload data and algos

<br>
<br>
!!!! Each algo needs to:

- provide what data was used for trianing (ideally OS) and needs to get tested by the platform.
