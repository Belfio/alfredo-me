## What the market is offering right now.

In the scinetific literature, when it comes to EMG signals we have a clear winner for the choice of the ADC, the medical grade Texas Instrument ADS1299.
This little chip comes at 50£ the unit - not cheap. The development boards range from £900 to £2000 from third party vendors (the own £177 Texas Instrument devkit is unavailble everywhere). 

Luckily I discovered this new board, the CERELOG ESP-EEG, built by an american engineer, that created the perfect development board for the great price of $349.99. I ordered one immediately, it arrived and I tested it immediately. It works! Or at least, when I run the test code and I touch the pins where the electrodes will go, a signal appear. If I place one finger in the GND and the other one buy one in the different pins, I can see the signal spiking in each one of the graphs separately. Great!

I need to buy the electrodes and the cables to start collecting EMG signals...
