# Anthropic's Theory of Change

## Dario Amodei's talks with Lex Friedman about their Thory of Change

It's a 2 ours interview and the bit I got fascinated the most was about the Theory of Change that Dario Amodei explained in the podcast and how it well applies in the real world.

Theory of Change is a framework for planning and evaluating the steps necessary to achieve a desired long-term goal. It is wildly used in the social impact space. Like all the well intentioned social impact endevours, it rearely see a practical use. The framework outlines the causal pathways, identifies the required preconditions, and specifies the interventions needed to facilitate and measure successful change.

## Example of a Social Impact Project Following a Theory of Change

### Project Name: Clean Water Initiative

**Goal:** Improve access to clean drinking water in rural communities.

**Theory of Change:**

1. **Inputs:** Funding, water purification technology, community education materials, trained personnel.
2. **Activities:**
   - Install water purification systems in targeted villages.
   - Conduct workshops on hygiene and maintenance of the systems.
   - Monitor water quality regularly.
3. **Outputs:**
   - Number of systems installed.
   - Number of community members trained.
   - Regular water quality reports.
4. **Outcomes:**
   - Increased access to clean water.
   - Improved community health.
   - Sustainable management of water resources.
5. **Impact:**
   - Reduction in waterborne diseases.
   - Enhanced quality of life in the communities.

This is a chatGPT project example. I have very little trust that this could ever happen and be succesful, for a variety of reasons. The main reason is, people are not incentivized in the long term to follow this plan.

## Anthropic's Theory of Change

Anthropic's mission is to deploy safe AI worldwide. Their social impact aims to enhance safety not only for their AI systems but for all AI globally. How? They offer a powerful AI equipped with safety features, using these features as a "competitive advantage." In this manner, when Anthropic and OpenAI engage with a new client, Anthropic can promote their safe AI, compelling OpenAI to develop their own safety features to remain appealing to the client.

The interesting aspect of this Theory of Change is the use of economic incentives (such as increased sales) to implement their changes in the world.

As Dario says, this creates a race to the top of AI safety, and once their competitive advantage gap is closed by other players, they will need to develop new safety features.
Smart!

## Tesla

A similat ToC was delivered by Tesla and their mission to move from fossil fuel to electricity and green energy. They created electric cars so good compared to the petrol cars, that will move the market towards electrivity,
