## Distribution and AI

While many companies are developing different solutions with different pricing, how does the different level of distribution influence how people will actually use the services?
What I mean is Apple at the moment hasn't come up with much yet. Apple Intelligence still needs to show its level compared to gpt o1 or claude. I use GPT often because I installed an app in my laptop and in my phone. However Apple doesn't need to do that and can deploy in billions of devices their solution. At that point, who is going to pay for GPT?

Google is placed in a similat position, having Android and the web on its side. Microsfot has an operative system andwill be able to push OpenAI in. This leaves Anthropic in a difficult spot, even thought they could rely on AWS to push their API and power the backend of the web.
