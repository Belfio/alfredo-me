# AI Race

## Distribution and AI

While many companies are developing diverse AI solutions with varying pricing models, the level of distribution significantly impacts how these services are adopted and utilized by the general public.

For instance, Apple has yet to introduce a comprehensive AI offering. Apple Intelligence needs to demonstrate its capabilities compared to established models like GPT-4 or Claude. Personally, I frequently use GPT because I have installed dedicated applications on my laptop and phone. In contrast, Apple has the advantage of seamlessly deploying its AI solutions across billions of devices without requiring users to install separate apps. This widespread and effortless integration raises the question: who will bear the costs associated with services like GPT when Apple can offer similar functionalities natively?

Similarly, Google occupies a unique position with the extensive reach of Android and its dominance in the web ecosystem. Microsoft's integration of OpenAI into its operating system further consolidates its ability to disseminate AI technologies widely. This extensive distribution network presents significant challenges for competitors like Anthropic, which, despite leveraging AWS to deploy their APIs and power web backends, may find it difficult to compete on the same scale as these tech giants.

The overarching theme here is that control over distribution channels is a critical factor in the AI race. Companies that can embed their AI solutions directly into widely-used platforms stand to gain a substantial competitive edge, potentially overshadowing those that rely solely on separate applications or APIs.
