# Pegasus: How did I start
## The future of sportswear and wearable devices

It's being a few years that I felt lost and not sure what to pursue next.
We are in the midst of a AI revolution and at the moment with my day job we are making something special and I cannot complain. However it won't last very long as i expect to get a nice exit from this. I want to test the water for what I will be doing a few years from now.

I am fascinated by Elon Musks mission letters, that with an amazing clarity and simplicity laid out the plan for his businesses. 
Everything starts from an understadning of the current problems and a vision for the future.

Elon's case was - we won't be running on fossil fuel forever, electric cars have many advantages and are a good step up for our environment. They will happen no matter what, when and who will build them is the question.

Similarly I believe that the medicine the way we know it will change. Better monitoring and preventitive measures will happen.
While personalised pills will be able to cure any disease, the detection os diseases and the insurgence of them will become paramount.

Cameras while we sleep and in the bathroom mirror will be common use like 8sleep matresses will become more and more adopted.
As well as sensors that can monitor feces and urine in our WCs and that could detect pathogens and alert accordingly.

Masks that people wear daily that purify the air and fill it with the ideal amount of oxygen.

And finally people will wear suits able monitor the body functions, protect the body and increasing its healing process.

I have been thinking about all these devices and I will run some experiments to start building each one of them, starting from the suit.
Rather than a suit I am thinking about sportswear, liks arms and calves sleeves, something leggins that looks like what people already use while doing sport, but with fitted sensors and actuators able to monitor, protect and heal the body. This project is called Pegasus.

So...what did I do? I started chatting with Claude Code and I ask to make me a full on report on the SOTA of wearable technologies, we discussed about the ability to embedd different sensors and actuators into an elastic sleeve and we agreed on a plan.

First sttep of the plan is to create a MVP: a calf sleeve that can understand the activation of the calf muscle and its fatigue. The Bill Of Materials includes - breadboard + ADC board for EMG + NIRS + 6DoF sensor. Let's go! The new Nike is starting.


**If you're an engineer, researcher, or investor interested in the intersection of sportswear and biomedical technology—I'd love to hear from you. This is an open journey, and the best work happens in collaboration.**
