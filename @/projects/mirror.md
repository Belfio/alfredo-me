## Passive video health monitoring system

AI is getting to the point that it can be as good as any docotr. What is missing in the system though is a way to gather data. The doctod can talk to you, look at you and ask you to go thorugh exams.
AI cannot (yet). A way to build up AI knowledge about you though is if a system is monitoring you. Monitoring often fails if it is a task a human has to do and repeat. However when it is passive and needs minimal intervention, it should work!
