## Passive video health monitoring system

AI is advancing to the point where it can be as good as any doctor. However, what is missing in the system is a way to gather data. A doctor can talk to you, observe you, and ask you to undergo exams. AI cannot (yet). A way to build up AI's knowledge about you is through a system that monitors you. Monitoring often fails if it requires a human to perform and repeat the task. However, when it is passive and requires minimal intervention, it should work!
