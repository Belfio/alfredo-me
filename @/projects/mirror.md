## Passive video health monitoring system

Many functions that a doctor executes are based on visual analysis. I assume that there are algorithms out there that can do an ok job and alarm people to get properly visited.

## What

- a camera
- lighting system
- an activation system
- power
- an AI system that analysis images and videos
- a processing unit (in-premise or cloud)
- a connection system

## Priority

1 - AI system, and check what's achievable now.
2 - HW system, cameras and lights
3 - Connection
