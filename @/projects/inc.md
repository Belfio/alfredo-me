## A new way of incorporating a business

I am a digital nomad, I live 3 months in a place, 1 year in another and 6 months in another. Where should I set up my business and bank account? What country? Can I found a company and open a bank account regardless of where I live?

## What

INC is a website that allows you to create a company with no jurisdiction. You sign up and get a company page. This comes with:

1. a private company page where you can modify the company details
1. a public company page
1. a public payment page you can use to get paid
1. a system to send money and schedule payments
1. a system to sell, assign, terminate shares of the company

## Technically how

This system is built in the Solana blockchain and runs with its stablecoin pegged to USD.

## Legally how

Legally it is not yet recognised and can incur in prosecution. We will be working on a set of legal contracts to make this entity as legal as possible and follow the Limited Liability standards.
