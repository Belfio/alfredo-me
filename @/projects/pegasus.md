# Pegasus: Sportswear/Biomedical Lab
## Monitor, protect and heal your body.

What will sportswear look like 10 years from now? Today there is no runner that runs without a smartwatch. The first smartwatches came out 12 years ago. The technology improved and the smartwatch is now used for sport and medical applications. 

What next?

Next-generation sportswear has the ability to monitor, protect and heal the entire body.

Pegasus is a bio-integrated smart body armor that combines soft robotics, multimodal sensing, and AI-driven control. It includes a series of sensors and actuators that makes it a full wearable biomedical lab. 

We train. We fatigue. We injure. We atrophy. We push our body to the limit.
We can wear a layer of clothing with sensors and actuators embedded that track our movement, support the recovery and prevent injuries.
EMG sensors to read muscle signals, NIRS to track oxygen saturation, NMES for targeted stimulation, all orchestrated by closed-loop AI. 


From athletes, we expand to rehabilitation, to aging, to human augmentation. The question isn't whether we'll merge with machines—it's how we'll do it thoughtfully, safely, and in a way that enhances rather than diminishes what it means to be human.

**If you're an engineer, researcher, or investor interested in the intersection of sportswear and biomedical technology—I'd love to hear from you. This is an open journey, and the best work happens in collaboration.**
