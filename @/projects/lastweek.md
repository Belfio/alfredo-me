# Emails to Podcast service

## Turn your weekly newsletters into a podcast

### The problem

I love my newsletters. I read Astral Codex, Matt Levine, Zvi, PG. However, I never have a week where I manage to read them all. This makes me sad and nervous.

### The solution

LastWeekFYI is a service that turns your weekly newsletters into a podcast. I normally have a lot of free time where I can listen to podcasts ( and I do it alread a lot ). At the gym, commuting, cleaning, running. Give me my Matt Levine to my ears!

### The product

It's a service that comes with an app. You forward all your newsletters to inbox@lastweek.fyi, and our service aggregates the weekly emails and add every week a new podcast with all the juicy written content.
